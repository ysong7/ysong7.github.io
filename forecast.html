						  <p>I study the social impacts of weather forecasts, one of the most common and most popular scientific forecasting public good in modern world. In this project, I focus on the setting in China, where weather forecasts have been generated by an uniform authority source, and I have collected a novel dataset of day-ahead city-level weather forecasts through video transcription with the Google Speech-to-Text API. Through revealed preference analysis, I have demonstrated that labor's decision-making on the intensive margin measured by daily hours worked takes into account the scientific product of weather forecasts as well as the perceived accuracy of such information. Through a valuation model of workers making decisions about future labor based on the weather forecast information and its perceived accuracy dependent on historical performance, I find that accurate weather forecasts in China are worth a large monetary value from the labor sector alone comparable to the annual budge of the national meteorological service. Overall, my work outlines the significance of accurate weather forecasts in assisting people's adaptation to near-future weather shocks, which also implies the increasingly crucial role of weather forecasts in the future world under climate change when more extreme weathers are expected. </p>
	
						    <p>My other works in this project analyze the effects of accurate weather forecasts in other sectors. In particular, the positive social value of accurate weather forecast information is also seen in people experiencing less negative sentiment shock as expressed on social media under cold temperatures, and that road congestion is reduced significantly when accurate cold temperature forecasts are provided day-ahead. </p>

						    <p>I am also studying the socio-economic impacts of air quality forecasts, driven by the increasing instances of smoke-related air pollutions due to forest fires in North America. In addition, I aim to study whether climate projections, especially the CMIP efforts since 1995, have the potentials to affect people's long-run decision makings, hence making the adaptation to scientific predictions influence the pathways of socio-economic development.
