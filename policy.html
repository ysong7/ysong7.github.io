						  <p> My research work focuses on the policy analysis in China, especially of multiple environmental and energy regulations over the past few decades during the country's fastest economic growth period proposed aiming to reduce the accompanying increasing air pollution. One policy I analyze is the country's long-run road rationing policy designed partially to reduce air pollution in 9 major cities, which restricts approximately 20% of cars on roads by their plate numbers during weekdays. Using difference-in-difference regression analysis, I find a close-to-zero average impacts of this long-term driving restriction policy on air quality improvement, which is different from previous literature presenting significant influence in reducing air pollution by the short-run version of road rationing. With China's recent active engagement targeting carbon emission reductions, the study may provide implications to the efficiency debates between command-and-control public policies versus market-based solutions. </p>
	
	<p>My other works include estimating the contribution of coal plant operations on local air pollution using the quasi-experimental design related to COVID lockdown early 2020, showing that coal plants still contribute significantly to air pollution. I also participate in studies of the energy sector in China, including exploring the evolution of Chinese energy supply and demand over the past few decades with a Sankey diagram, and using an energy structure forecast model constructed using Markov-chain to predict the energy consumption and substitution for the city of Beijing.
