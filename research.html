    <i>This paper evaluates the economic value of the accurate information of weather forecasts, a common and popular public good continuously invested by the government in modern societies. Labor decisions of hours worked per day are found to respond to day-ahead temperature forecasts, and only forecasts that are perceived as accurate are incorporated. From this, improvements in weather forecast accuracy generate large social benefits. With the setting in China, where the developing economy provides a trusted uniform source of national weather forecasts to its large population, I collect a novel dataset of the city-level day-ahead weather forecasts directly broadcast to the general public through video transcription for over 2000 days of the country's popular weather forecasts TV program. Constructing the metric of perceived forecast accuracy based on the medium-run root mean squared errors of historical temperature forecasts, I run a regression with the interaction of forecasts and forecast accuracy to estimate how labor response to forecast temperatures varies under different levels of forecast accuracy across time and space. My main regression results suggest large reductions of labor supply up to 4.5 and 1.2 hours per day under hot (above 30C) and medium-cold (15C-25C) daily maximum temperature forecasts only when these forecasts are accurate. Instead, when forecasts are inaccurate, those negative labor responses diminish. Using a simple utility maximization model for the next-day labor decision and evaluating with the regression estimates, I estimate a large marginal value of forecast accuracy of 930 2015 Yuan (148 USD) per capita per year. For the entire country, an average 3.9% increase in forecast accuracy from 2011 to 2015 generates a partial social benefit from the labor sector alone at 25.3 billion 2015 Yuan (4.03 billion USD) per year, about covering the annual cost of the national weather forecasting system. </i>

    <i>This paper combines real weather data with the city-daily weather forecasts broadcast by the government, as well as the sentiment index expressed by posts on the popular social media Weibo in China, and through an interactive regression design analyzes the differential sentiment responses to temperatures under different sizes and signs of daily temperature forecast errors. My main results have suggested that more accurate temperature forecasts lead to smaller shifts towards unhappiness caused by the cold temperatures. The same effects does not play out under hot weathers, unless in cities with higher income, greater long run temperature forecast accuracy, or during holidays. My study also suggests that additional negative sentiment shocks are likely related to cold or heat alarms issued according to the national forecasts, resulting in that positive forecast errors have greater marginal effects on sentiment than negative errors during the cold temperatures. Overall, these results meet the intuition that advanced forecast technology provides more accurate daily temperature forecasts, and adds to great social benefits in China in terms of improving people's subjective well-beings as expressed by social media sentiments. In the current time under climate change, when extremal weather events are expected with greater frequency into the future, my work would help to provide an insight of the value of developing a modern weather forecasting system that can benefit billions of people in the long run. </i>

    <i>This project explores the long-run efficiency of the end-number license plate driving restriction in China, a traffic control policy aiming at reducing city level air pollution. Difference-in-difference (DID) regression analysis is conducted for a panel including 9 cities implementing this long run policy staggeringly over the period 2008-2013, contrasting to the set of control cities in China without the continuous implementations of this policy over the years 2005-2015. Consistent with previous studies on road rationing, this project has shown that the driving restriction policy on average is not improving air pollution in China in the long term. Quantitatively, the policy would reduce the daily city level AQI (air quality index) by a statistically insignificant 0.04% at most, translating to welfare gains of only 0.08 dollars per person per year and 0.004 life years per capita. </i>

    <i>An active current debate is whether polar amplification under a warming climate increases the waviness of the jet stream and hence the frequency of extreme temperatures in the midlatitudes.  We approach this question by analyzing the statistics of near surface temperature in the Northern hemisphere wintertime from a reanalysis product (ERA5) and climate model simulations (4 CMIP6 models under SSP585).  Specifically, we compute an equivalent latitude of surface temperature, a rough measure of what latitude the surface air parcel traveled from under an adiabatic condition.  By analyzing the local statistics of equivalent latitude, we can quantify the extent of latitudinal excursion of air under changing climate: a longer tail of equivalent latitude means extended latitudinal excursions of near-surface air parcels. We find that climate models reproduce well the patterns of wintertime midlatitudes temperature variations seen in reanalysis, with eastward-propagating disturbances of zonal wavenumber 6-8, consistent with Rossby wave influence, with propagation speeds typical of the background flow. In future projections, midlatitudes wintertime temperature variance decreases strongly by the end of the century, consistent with previous studies. The use of equivalent latitude allows us to partition this change into contributions due to either the weakening meridional temperature gradient or the changes in the distribution of air mass origin. We find no evidence of consistent broadening of distributions of equivalent latitude that would suggest increased future jetstream waviness. While these results do not directly address the dynamics of the jetstream, a simple metric based on surface temperature is suggestive of the consequences of dynamical changes, and is directly applicable to the socioeconomic impacts that drive concerns over climate change.</i>
